Just a few quick things one quickly noticed as of late while using the existing lang pack (Version 1.8.21 (stable) 2019-06-15, 02:23 PM https://community.mybb.com/mods.php?action=view&pid=662 ) on 1830 while translating some plugins:


As these issues should be fixed, let us quickly apply the minor fix for such.


front-end side...

global.lang.php needs such added:

[code]
$l['expcol_collapse'] = '[-]';
$l['expcol_expand'] = '[+]';
$l['confirm_title'] = "Si prega di confermare";
$l['ratings_update_error'] = 'Si Ã¨ verificato un errore durante l\'aggiornamento della classificazione.';
[/code]


memberlist.lang.php needs such added:

[code]
$l['exactly'] = "Esattamente:";
[/code]


usercp.lang.php needs such added:

[code]
$l['goto_first_unread'] = "Vai al primo post non letto";
[/code]


admin side...

admin/forum_management.lang.php needs such added:

[code]
$l['forum_thread_prefixes'] = "Prefissi di thread";
[/code]


admin/config_thread_prefixes.lang.php needs such added:

[code]
$l['forums'] = "Disponibile nei forum";
[/code]


admin/config_badwords.lang.php needs such added:

[code]
$l['add_bad_word_desc'] = "Qui puoi aggiungere un filtro di parole e la sua sostituzione.";
[/code]


admin/style_themes.lang.php needs such added:

[code]
$l['theme_thumbnail'] = "Miniatura del tema";
[/code]


etc, etc... & most likely there may be more as one notices / finds such, but, just noting all found here initially at least of all the first few warnings about such in relation to subject matter and current usage on 1830. 

Best of luck.
